# Enhanced Scouts
This mod improves the abilities of the seasoned scouts. By default FreeCol/Colonization's only benefit to having a seasoned scout is to improve rumor chances. This mod also gives the seasoned scout extended sight radius, and additional movement capabilities, thus making the seasoned scout a more valuable unit to use for exploration of the new world.
