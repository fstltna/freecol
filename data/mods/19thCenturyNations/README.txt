Hi. This is final version of the mod. (v1.4) The changes were made to make the gameplay less weird. I changed the monarchs, ports, some colony names, add ship names, thanks for marcin for that.
I decided to change belgium coat of arms, add ref's coat of arms (I added the ref's crown with the mod folder, if you want to use it), changed the nations colours and add generic nation bonus (I really dont have clue on what to add as nation bonus).

I apreciate all the help and feedback, sorry for my mistakes about the older versions of the mod.
Thanks to Marcin for the help with ships names.

If you want, you can change the mod in your computer or use it as a base for the creation of other nation's mods.
Warning: dont sell or make money with the mod, this mod was made free to all freecol players and should remain free. feel free to distribute free
