# Shippable Wagons
This mod allows you to load wagon trains onto Galleons. The caveat is that you cannot move a wagon train onto a galleon from the colony screen. You can direct your wagon train onto a galleon from the map screen by moving the wagon train onto the galleon. The wagon train will take up all 6 cargo spaces, but can carry it's own 2 units of goods. This will enable you to transport tradable goods from one location to another to train with europeans or natives.

You can unload the wagon train from the Galleon on the colony screen by choosing "unload" on the Galleon. From the map screen, simply disembark as you would any other unit. Or right-click on the Galleon and select the wagon train to move it onto land.
