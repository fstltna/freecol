# FreeCol Mod
This is a [FreeCol](http://www.freecol.org/) Mod. FreeCol is a turn-based strategy game based on the old game Colonization, and similar to Civilization. The objective of the game is to create an independent nation. You start with only a few colonists defying the stormy seas in their search for new land.

# Basic Buildings
This Mod makes a colony entirely blank except for the Town Hall, carpenter house, depot, and pasture. Effectively making each building within a colony a requirement to build before it can be used. This puts a much bigger emphasis on being able to build buildings and is more 'realistic' for colonial times. A note about crosses, a chapel is required to produce crosses, thus a Colony will not produce any crosses until a chapel is built.
